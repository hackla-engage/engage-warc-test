-   title: "Award Agreement for Citywide Roofing Contractor Services"
    agenda_item_id: 3448
    department: "Public Works, Facilities Maintenance"
    discussion: "The Facilities Maintenance Division contracts out approximately 30 roofing projects annually. These projects include repairs, replacements, leak mitigation, and installing coatings, gutters, roof drains and skylights. It is necessary to contract out these jobs as in-house staff do not possess the necessary equipment, specialized skills, training and licensing.\nTo ensure the City has access to the best pricing, prompt response times and applicable project expertise, staff recommends splitting the award between Best Contracting Services, Inc., Letner Roofing and Maverick Roofing, Inc. Best Contracting Services, Inc. would primarily provide roofing services such as leak mitigation and waterproofing as Best Contracting has satisfactorily provided such services for the City over the past three years. Based on Letner Roofing’s extensive experience with multi-million dollar projects, Letner Roofing would provide services for the City’s large-scale projects that are often long-term, intricate and require a large workforce. Maverick Roofing, Inc. has the lowest minimum call-out charge and fastest response time, thus Maverick Roofing would perform urgent and minor repairs that require a prompt response time and are small-scale in nature."
